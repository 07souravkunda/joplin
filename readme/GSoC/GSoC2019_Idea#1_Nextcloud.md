## Nextcloud notes integration (Web client)

Nextcloud (and others): depper integration or app based on

- [Support Joplin structure and notebooks #248](https://github.com/nextcloud/notes/issues/248)
- [Joplin Web](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/joplin-web-web-application-companion-for-joplin/555)
- [New search engine in Joplin](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/new-search-engine-in-joplin/1479)
- [How is WebDAV sync implemented?](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/how-is-webdav-sync-implemented/3102)
- [Nextcloud notes integration (Web client)](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/issues/228)


“Nextcloud notes integration (Web client)” is not well defined. What would be nice is a built-in Nextcloud web client for Joplin. But the top post in there is about something else that won’t be changed (explained in the FAQ: https://joplinapp.org/faq/#is-it-possible-to-use-real-file-and-folder-names-in-the-sync-target)

That would be interesting to know what they think about such an integration and how they see it because it’s an old subject, we (the staff) are periodically debating:

- https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/issues/228
- https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/nextcloud-fanboy-quest-ce-quils-veulent/844/3

I imagined they just need a joplin-api in PHP and “plug” it on the right datasource to switch between “Nextcloud native note/Qownote” to Nextcloud/Qownnote “Joplin note”.
