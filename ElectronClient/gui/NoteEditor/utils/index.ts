	// enough), the editor emits onChange, and that event will include the editor content.

	// Both onWillChange and onChange events include a changeId property which is used
	// to link the two events together. It is used for example to detect if a new note
	// was loaded before the current note was saved - in that case the changeId will be
	// different. The two properties bodyWillChangeId and bodyChangeId are used to save
	// this info with the currently loaded note.
	//
	// The willChange/onChange events also allow us to handle the case where the user
	// types something then quickly switch a different note. In that case, bodyWillChangeId
	// is set, thus we know we should save the note, even though we won't receive the
